Many developers use a helpful website, codetrov, as their go-to code coverage report 
generator. In fact, it's so popular that various developers upload their test 
results to the site every 30 seconds or so. 

To view the codecov website, visit localhost:5000 on your local web browser, 
or `curl http://codetrov` at any time.
