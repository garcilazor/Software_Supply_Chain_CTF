Welcome to **Software Supply Chain CTF**.  
This repository contains the necessary code to build all of the levels for the CTF which consist of:  
* Abandoned Dependencies
* Bitcoin
* Compromise Developer Account (CDA)
* Compromise Developer Workflow (CDW
* Confused Dependencies
* Frozen Dependency
* Internal Dependency
* Malicious Contributor
* SBOM
* Typosquatting
* VScode

These levels reflect various forms of a software supply chain attack. Each Level is associated with a codelab that will act as a guided walkthrough.  
We created this repository for Portland State University Computer Science Capstone Project Spring-Summer 2021.
